    GoodGames is an game cataloging website that allows individuals to rate, comment on, and browse video games of all types. Users can sign up and register to add games to their Game Center to let others know what games they want to play, what they are currently playing, and what they have already played.

## Obstacles

### Rating API

We noticed that we needed to calculate the user rating for each game in a number of places, so we decided it would be best to implement a calcRating helper function. This allows us to keep our code clean and precise.

Helper Function (calcRating):

### User Game Status Persistance

Depending on how a user has a specific game catorized in their game center, we wanted the chosen (red) status button to persist when they navigate back to that specific game page. This required figuring out a solution to prevent the previous game status after the user had changed that status.
